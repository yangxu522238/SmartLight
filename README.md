# SmartLight

The project is based on the intelligent lighting system developed by the qucalcomm CSR1025 development kit.
The user can control the status of the light through the mobile APP. For example, after we open the door at night, 
we must first go to find the light switch. For smart lighting based on qucalcomm CSR1025, 
you only need to click the switch on the APP to turn on the lights at home.

Materials Used
---------------
Dragonboard 410c
CSR1025 develop board

Instruction
========
HardWare Setup 
--------
Take a wire and connect the power bulb CSR1025 in series.

Note: you should connect rely on 1 and 2 .

SoftWare Setup
------------
	1. xIDE environment installation
	xIDE is an IDE integrated development environment developed by Qualcomm for the CSR platform. The xIDE SDK can quickly complete the development and design of the Bluetooth control project based on the CSR102x platform.
Download the CSR102x development SDK and demo code, find CSR102x_SDK-3.1.1.20.exe, double-click to install the SDK

2.After the installation is completed, the xIDE application will be generated under Windows, and the application will be the integrated development platform of CSR102X, as shown in the following figure.
 
3. Use xIDE to preview the CSR102X project code and open the demo code as shown below.

4.
Step one：you install QT and PyCharm on your PC .

Step two: you develop and debug in your pc

Step three: you copy the code on 410C board and run it (python + the path of maintable’s file)
