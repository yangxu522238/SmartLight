# SmartLight

The project is based on the intelligent lighting system developed by the qucalcomm CSR1025 development kit.
The user can control the status of the light through the mobile APP. For example, after we open the door at night, 
we must first go to find the light switch. For smart lighting based on qucalcomm CSR1025, 
you only need to click the switch on the APP to turn on the lights at home.
